AI-Enhanced Polymer Formulation Discovery System
CampAIgn Project Application - Faculty of Polymer Technology, Slovenia

Project Overview
This is an interactive, scalable AI system for accelerated polymer formulation discovery that combines:

Alice - Generative AI (LLM) for knowledge synthesis

Victor - Machine Learning for predictive modeling

Frank - Multi-objective optimization for formulation discovery

The system demonstrates human-AI collaboration in material science R&D.
